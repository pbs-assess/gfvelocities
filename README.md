## gfvelocities: spatiotemporal modelling of groundfish biomass density change in response to climate

This package contains the code used in the analysis described in the manuscript posted as preprint at https://ecoevorxiv.org/b87ng/.

These functions were built for use with British Columbia synoptic trawl survey data and prediction grids from spatiotemporal models built with the package [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/index.html).
This analysis also relies on many of the same data extraction, data tidying, model fitting, and plotting functions underlying **[A reproducible data synopsis report for over 100 species of British Columbia groundfish](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2019/2019_041-eng.html)** that are available in the packages [gfplot](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfplot) and [gfdata](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfdata). In some cases functions from these packages have been modified and the customized versions included in this package. 

Velocity calculation functions are designed and annotated in an effort for them to be usable (or easily modified for use) with other data types. 

*This is a work in progress: arguments may still change and not all functionality has been tested.*
